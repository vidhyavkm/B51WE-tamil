Promise
 - What is a promise?
 - Promise States
 - Promise chain
 - promise.all()
 - Use of fetch() & then()

Session Practice task in rest countries API:
https://restcountries.eu/

promise:

->is one of the method to handle async functions.
->developers used it to get the datas from an api.

giving an assurance
happen/ not happen

it has 2 parameters
resolve and reject

3 states in promise

1. pending=> initial state=> pending unless or untill async ops in process
2. fulfilled => we will get the value 
3. rejected.=> fails, throws error.

syntax:

let xyz = new Promise();

here in promise we can handle the errors.
 using .then() and .catch()
 here we will recieve error msg along with the state.

promise always returns an object
it can either fulfiled or rjected 
but both cant occur at the same time.

promisechaining/ dependant operations

handle multiple async operations.
.then and .catch used many times
complexity level is high, time consuming.

-to overcome this we can use promiseall.
-if all get fulfilled(resolved) it works well.
-suppose any one async function throws error(rejected)
-it doesnt shows the fulfilled one also.
-this is a major drawback of promiseall.

-to overcome this promiseallsettled is introduced.
-it will give all the results in object format.

fetch:

is an alternative for xmlhttprequest.
xhr = output is always an object
fetch => object and it returns a promise.

to handle the error in fetch, we can use .then 2 times.
