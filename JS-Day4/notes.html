spread operator: 
in js functions we can use more than one spread operator.

syntax: (...)

=> it helps us to expand an iterable such as an array whre multiple arguments are need.
=> it helps to expand the object expressions.
=> used to merge two arrays or more than one array.
=> used to add one or more indexes in an array.
=> used to copy the objects.

<!-- var a = userInput[0];guvi
console.log(...a); --> g u 'v' 'i'

rest operator:

syntax: (...)

in js functions there is only one rest operator.
=> we can use only in functions parameter.
=> compresses the elements.
=> in functions, when we require to pass arguements but were nt sure 
how many we have to pass, the rest operator makes it easier.

destructure:
traditional => const var.name = [values...]
syntax: const [values..] = variable name

used to unpack the values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

obj shorthand :
  
introduced in ES6.
it shortens the object. 
it allows us to define an object whose keys have the same names as 
varibles passed in as properties .

void=> doesnot return a value. 

template literals:
 to add or to join or to put multiple values in a same string we can go for t.l
