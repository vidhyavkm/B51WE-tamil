Map, Reduce, Filter

Map:

works in an array.
works each and every index in an array.
returns a new array.
it always takes function as a parameter.
it does not change the length of the array.
we cant use map if we want to change one particular element an array.

syntax: arr.map()=> ES6.

arr.map((index)=> index*2)
        console.log(res);

        
Filter:

works in an array.
works each and every index in an array.
returns a same array with same elements
it always takes function as a parameter.
it does change the length of the array.(reduce)
it eliminate something as per the condition.

1,2,3,4,5=> 1,3,5

syntax: arr.map()=> ES6.

arr.filter((index)=> index*2)
        console.log(res);


Reduce:

works in an array.
works each and every index in an array.
returns a single value not an array.
it always takes function as a parameter.
it does change the length of the array.

it has 2 parameter(accumulator and current value)
if we are not giving acc value it takes the 0th index as acc.


syntax: arr.reduce(acc,curr)=> ES6.

pop()=> removes last element
push() => adds last element
shift() => removes first element
unshift() =>  adds new first element
length() => gives the lengthof array
join() => joins the array indexes
splice() => add new items in an array(2,0,add items)
slice() => removes the partcilcular index.
concat() => to join twp arrays
tostring() => converts the array into a string
