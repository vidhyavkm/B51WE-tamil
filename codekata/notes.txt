javascript datatypes:
primitive => string, number, boolean.
composite 
trivial

string => those who are inside the quotes "", ''=> "guvi", "2"
number => ex:1 2 3, 1/4, 4.5 etc
boolean => true or false.

composite:

arrays and objects:

arrays
 => represent as [], seperated by commos.ex:[1,2,3,4]
 => group of elements.(it includes all kind of datatypes)
 => heterogeneous elements.ex:[1,"1","guvi",true,"false"]=> length = 5
 => elements inside arrays are called indexes.
 => starts with index 0.
 => ends with length-1.

array methods and string methods.

split()=> is a function used to seperate each and every element in an array and it returns an array. 
join() => is a function used to join each and every element in an array and it returns an string.

forloop:

to reduce the time and length of the code we can use for loop.
 
syntax:
 for (initialization; condition; inc or dec){
    block of code or console.log()
 }

if/else;

to explain whether the condition is true or false

if (age>18){
    console.log("eligible")
}
else{
    console.log("not eligible")
}
sort => arrange orderwise
 alpahbetically it works fine.
abi, priya , john, returns
abi, john, priya, returns

arr = [11, 4, 3, 55, 79]

[3,4,11,55,79]
